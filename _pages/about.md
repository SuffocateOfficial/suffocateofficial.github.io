# About

Built on the weight of emotion and the chaos of sound, this project isn't about perfection - it's about honesty.

## More Than Music

This is more than music. It's a reflection of the darkest moments and the fight to breathe through them. Heavy, raw, and unapologetic. Every track is a release, a scream, a story.

## Thanks

Thanks for listening. Thanks for feeling this with us.

## Our Purpose

We're not here to be saved. We're here to be heard.
